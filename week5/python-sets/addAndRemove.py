# Addition of an element, can be done by using add(),
# We can add multiple elements with update():
s = { 3, 6, 'bibi', ('Simon', 'Garfunkel') }
s.add(5)
print(s)
s.update([11, 22], (55,), ('mimi',))
print(s)
# update() unpacks the given arguments and adds them to the set.
# Note that if ‘mimi’ would have been given outside a dedicated tuple, ‘m’ and ‘i’ letters would be added.
# Deleting an element from set
# del is not supported in sets:
s = { 'Avi', 'Itzik', 'Kobi' }

# del s['Avi'] # Error
# The proper way would be using discard() or remove() methods:
s.discard('Avi')
s.remove('Itzik')
# The difference between them is that when trying to delete an element which does not exist, remove() throws an exception, and discard() returns None:
s.remove('Itzik') # KeyError: 'Itzik'
print(s.discard('Itzik')) # None
# It is also possible to remove items from a set by calling pop().
# The removal will be done arbitrarily (as there is no order):
s = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
s.pop()
# With clear(), we can remove all items:
print(s)
s.clear()
print(s)
# Membership
# We can ask if a certain key exists in a set by using in:
'T' in s
